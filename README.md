# THD Game Server Admin - Java/Swing admin client for THD Games

This is a kinda simple swing app which connects to the socket admin game server protocol for the following games made by TransHuman Design (www.thd.vg):
- Soldat (http://www.soldat.pl)
- King Athur's Gold (http://www.kag2d.com)

Build dependency's/jars:

- Jogle and associated libs for OSs you build this for

Features:

- Multiple servers for either game in multiple tabs
- List of players currently in server, as well as ip2country picture and HW ID where applicable
- Console log with color codes as well as inline pictures
- OpenGL map renderer for Soldat maps where applicable
- Tested on Windows, Mac, and Linux

Notes:

- Code is mostly horrible as I had not intended for this to be released publicly. After not working on it for a month and a half I might as well.
- It's developed in Neatbeans as it allegedly has better support for designing Swing forums
- The code for parsing Soldat maps is written by Joe Finney (iDante) not me
- Most credit for code which generates OpenGL is pieced together from bad tutorials on the web and advice from Roland Bewick
- Licensed under GPL
